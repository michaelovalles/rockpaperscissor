10.24.25.
---------
Adding notes to projects to keep track of what I did and what is needed.

As of today,
CMakelists only contains the minimum to connect to main.

a collection of programs were created:

capitalizationChange.cxx =  changes letters toLowercase(), and toUppercase().
------------------------
collision.cxx = accepts objects and checks collision.
------------- players chooses objects between (rock, paper, and scissor)
and checks collision/outcome.or) interacts. results in outcome printed.

character.cxx = polymorphism of rock, paper, or scissor.
-------------

menu.cxx = takes in input and of choice, results in action.
--------

input.cxx = Request input and returns input using toLowercase().
---------

idea to work on:
create a bot that chooses at random.
+ randomNumGen() = chooses (1,2,3) randomly. 

created:

randomNumGen.cxx = creates a random number between 1-3.
----------------

create a bot that uses random number to make choice.
done. 
bot.cxx = takes in random number, returns string (rock, paper, scissor).
-------

create a playground = gathers all componets to play the game 
FINISH POINTERS IN PLAYGROUND()
10.25.25. Clocking In: 
pointer keeps deleting before use, im thinking of making original pointer a unique_ptr, or putting the whole project in a class in which i create the pointer in a constructer and delete in a deconstructer.. not sure yet, but my be ideal.
In menu.cxx, which release pointer I with the help of google changed the pointer passed as a static variable,
I changed the pointers to a static varible, which were recieved by a pointer after return, This seems to have fixed the free()
double free error. (clocking out 4:55am 10.26.25).
